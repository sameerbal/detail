Hi JK,

As per today’s call, I have tried below things and results are as follow :

1.	Writing bulk records :
Which consists Row missing in Target i.e; 1369 rows and 90 columns
Takes 6 mins (391 secs)
File Size 3961 kb

Logic for bulk writing :
Collecting all data mismatch, Row Missing Source, Row Missing Target in 3 different Arraylist
Opening excel once 
Writing whole data one by one ArrayList
Example : 
Data Mismatch ArrayList
Row Missing Source ArrayList
Row Missing Target ArrayList
Closing the excel at the end .

2.	Writing one by one records :
Which consists Row missing in Target i.e; 1369 rows and 90 columns
Takes 5 mins (355 secs)
File Size 3961 kb

Logic for one by one writing :
Opening excel once writing data one by one and closing the excel at the end of all.

3.	Writing 1000 Data Mismatch :
1000 rows 4 columns which consists Primary Key, Column Name, Source Data, Target Data
It took just 1 minute

Conclusion : If we are writing to excel with 1000 data mismatch,1000 row missing source, 1000 row missing target it will take approx.. 12 – 15 mins with Excelfile size of nearly 7000 KB (Depends on number of Columns).

Thanks
Sameer
